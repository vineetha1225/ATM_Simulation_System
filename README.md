# ATM Simulation System
A desktop-based banking simulation project that mimics real ATM operations such as user authentication, cash withdrawal, balance inquiry, and transaction history. Built using Java with a graphical interface designed using AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit) and a MySQL database connected via JDBC for backend operations.

## Key Features: ##
* User login and PIN authentication.
* Withdraw, Deposit, and Balance Inquiry functions.
* Transaction history with date and time logs.
* Admin panel for user account management.
* Basic input validation and error handling.
* User-friendly GUI with AWT components (labels, buttons, text fields, etc.)

## Technologies Used: ##
* Frontend/UI: Java AWT
* Backend: Java, JDBC
* Database: MySQL
* IDE: IntelliJ 

## Database Operations: ##
* User data and account details are stored in MySQL tables.
* JDBC is used for connecting Java application to the database for performing CRUD operations.
* Secure PIN authentication with validation logic.

## Learning Outcomes: ##
* Hands-on experience with GUI development in Java.
* Integration of Java with MySQL using JDBC.
* Understanding of real-world banking workflows and logic implementation.
* Basic implementation of MVC architecture principles.
